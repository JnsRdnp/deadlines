                "Deadlines" calculates how many assignments you need to tackle each day to stay on track and shows you 
                how many assignments you should have completed by now, so you know you are not falling behind.

                I have personally learned from experience that when you study all at once, you won't really learn that much. 
                I had previously used an Excel file to help me ensure that I was doing enough work each day to meet the deadlines. 
                Then, I realized it would be a great learning opportunity for me to create a website that functions like my Excel.

                Currently, deadline synchronization across devices isn't possible, and data is only saved locally on your current device using localStorage. 
                In the future, I might introduce synchronization through a Single Sign-On (SSO) for a more seamless experience.
